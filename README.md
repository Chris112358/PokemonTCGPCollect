# Pokemon TCG Pocket Collection App

The reason for this App is to keep track of your collection in the offical App of Pokemon TCG Pocket.
This App is not official and only a first Android Project for me.

You can track what Cards you already got and than can see statistics about which Pack you should pull, based on the probability to pull a new card.
Only Main Packs are included in these statistics, so up until today packs A1, A1a and A2.
